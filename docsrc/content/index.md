# datastax-alwaysonsql-workshop

This is a 2-hour introductory workshop on DataStax AlwaysOnSQL.

### Motivation

AlwaysOnSQL is a key DSE capability that differentiates DataStax from competitors.  However, prospects often do not understand the capabilities of AlwaysOnSQL, and do not know how to use it.  

This workshop helps prospects become familiar with AlwaysOnSQL.  We take a "practitioner" approach, with minimal focus on internals.

### What is included?

Studio notebooks, a pre-populated keyspace, executable code, and a corresponding presentation (with detailed speaker notes) walk the students through the most important capabilities of AlwaysOnSQL for database-centric applications.

* Basic SQL functionality
* JDBC connectivity
* ODBC connectivity
* Java coding 

### Business Take Aways

AlwaysOnSQL adds a crucial capability that is especially important to Business Analysts, Developers, and other stakeholders who want to leverage their SQL skills with DSE.

### Technical Take Aways

AlwaysOnSQL adds a crucial capability that is not found in open-source Cassandra.
